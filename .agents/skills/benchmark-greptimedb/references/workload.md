A query-set identity includes the logical dataset identity and specification,
Greptime query format, use case, seed, timestamp range, and the sorted
query-type-to-count map. A subset is a complete set with only those files.
Generation publishes the directory atomically; generator commands and stderr
remain in the initiating run rather than the shared set.

Dataset compression is pinned by the run and is part of dataset identity.
Plain and gzip artifacts use separate dataset directories; canonical
uncompressed size and SHA-256 still describe the generated logical content.

## Profiles

Both profiles use seed `123`, interval `10s`, data use case `cpu-only`, query
use case `devops`, Influx line protocol data, and Greptime query format.

| Setting | `manual` (default) | `smoke` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start | `2023-06-11T00:00:00Z` | `2023-06-11T00:00:00Z` |
| End | `2023-06-14T00:00:00Z` | `2023-06-12T00:00:00Z` |
| Hosts | 4000 | 10 |
| Load workers | 6 | 2 |
| Query workers | 1 | 1 |
| Batch size | 3000 | 3000 |

The query generator receives the end timestamp plus one second.

## Explain analysis

Analysis is managed-only. For each selected query type, the runner restarts
GreptimeDB and executes query index `0` as the cold `EXPLAIN ANALYZE VERBOSE`
request. It then executes generated query indices `1..N` as hot requests without
another restart. Predicate-based types vary their SQL; invariant types such as
`lastpoint` repeat the same SQL. `N` defaults to two and is configurable with
`--hot-runs`. The selected query-set count for every type must be at least
`N + 1`.

Each response artifact preserves the original SQL, executed explain SQL, phase,
query index, and complete GreptimeDB HTTP JSON response. Attempts are immutable:
repeating a type in one run creates `run-002`, then `run-003`, and so on. A
process restart does not clear the operating-system filesystem cache.

## Query counts

Profile counts are defaults. `--queries=N` replaces the default for every
selected type, and repeatable `--query-count TYPE=N` entries take final
precedence for individual types. If `--query-count` is used without
`--query-type`, only the named types belong to the query set. If
`--query-type` is present, it defines membership and every per-type override
must target one of those types.

`--query-scope full` is the default. `fixed-host` permits
`cpu-max-all-{1,8}`, `high-cpu-1`, and the six `single-groupby-*` types; explicit
types or counts outside the scope are rejected. Recommend this explicit scope
at 10,000 hosts or more. Recommend gzip at 50 million estimated `cpu-only`
points, where points are `scale × floor(duration / interval)`.

| Query type | Manual | Smoke |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `cpu-max-all-1` | 100 | 10 |
| `cpu-max-all-8` | 100 | 10 |
| `double-groupby-1` | 50 | 10 |
| `double-groupby-5` | 50 | 10 |
| `double-groupby-all` | 50 | 10 |
| `groupby-orderby-limit` | 50 | 10 |
| `high-cpu-1` | 100 | 10 |
| `high-cpu-all` | 50 | 10 |
| `lastpoint` | 10 | 10 |
| `single-groupby-1-1-1` | 100 | 10 |
| `single-groupby-1-1-12` | 100 | 10 |
| `single-groupby-1-8-1` | 100 | 10 |
| `single-groupby-5-1-1` | 100 | 10 |
| `single-groupby-5-1-12` | 100 | 10 |
| `single-groupby-5-8-1` | 100 | 10 |

## Database state

Managed workspace manifests bind `database_id`, SQL database name, and one
loaded dataset specification/checksum. Workspaces prepared by
`$setup-greptimedb` additionally bind an exact installation version, platform,
path, and binary checksum. A matching dataset is reused. A
different dataset requires a successfully confirmed reset before the binding
changes. External `create`, `reuse`, and `reset` map to the corresponding TSBS
loader flags; external reuse may duplicate data.

The database manifest's installation identity describes the version bound when
the workspace was prepared or copied. A confirmed query-only override does not
change it. The run target records the actual runtime version and checksum plus
the workspace-bound identity, making separate runs safe to compare without
rebinding metadata.

Copied workspaces retain the source dataset binding and record their origin,
source manifest checksum, full-copy method, and copied file and byte counts.
They use independent storage and empty log directories.

## Version comparisons

Comparison artifacts use one explicit baseline and one or more candidates.
They accept different managed database IDs so a source and copied workspace can
be compared, but reject different SQL database names, datasets, query sets,
query counts, repetitions, incomplete results, or failures. Per-query results
contain baseline and candidate weighted means, millisecond and percentage
deltas, candidate/baseline latency ratios, classifications, and source log
paths. A zero baseline produces no ratio or percentage unless both values are
zero. Comparisons report regressions but do not enforce thresholds.
