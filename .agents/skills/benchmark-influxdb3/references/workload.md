Both Core and Enterprise consume the same `influx` line-protocol dataset and
native InfluxDB 3 SQL query set. Reuse identical artifacts, query order,
workers, batch sizes, and durability flags for comparisons.

Compression is pinned by the run and is part of dataset identity. Plain and
gzip artifacts use separate dataset directories. Gzip is streamed into the
loader without a temporary plain file.

## Profiles

| Setting | `manual` (default) | `smoke` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Start | `2023-06-11T00:00:00Z` | `2023-06-11T00:00:00Z` |
| End | `2023-06-14T00:00:00Z` | `2023-06-12T00:00:00Z` |
| Hosts | 4000 | 10 |
| Load workers | 16 | 2 |
| Query workers | 1 | 1 |
| Batch size | 25000 | 3000 |

Both use seed `123`, interval `10s`, `cpu-only` data, `devops` queries,
durable WAL acknowledgement, and rejection of partial batches. The query end
timestamp is the dataset end plus one second.

Profile query counts are defaults. `--queries=N` replaces the default for
every selected type, and repeatable `--query-count TYPE=N` entries override
individual counts. Without `--query-type`, per-type entries define query-set
membership; with `--query-type`, every override must target a selected type.
The resolved type-to-count mapping is part of the immutable query-set identity.

`--query-scope full` is the default. `fixed-host` permits
`cpu-max-all-{1,8}`, `high-cpu-1`, and the six `single-groupby-*` types; explicit
types or counts outside the scope are rejected. Recommend this explicit scope
at 10,000 hosts or more. Recommend gzip at 50 million estimated `cpu-only`
points, calculated as `scale × floor(duration / interval)`.

The manual load settings are InfluxDB-specific overrides selected by
`docs/influx3-ingestion-benchmark.md`; shared TSBS and GreptimeDB profile
defaults remain unchanged. Explicit `--load-workers` and `--batch-size` flags
take precedence. Core 3.11.1 rejected a 100,000-row batch because its encoded
request exceeded 10 MiB, so do not assume arbitrarily larger batches are valid.

## Database and target state

Managed database manifests pin the database ID, edition, exact version, binary
checksum, node/cluster identity, sanitized file/S3 storage identity, SQL database,
and one loaded dataset checksum. External
targets require an explicit edition and may provide multiple URLs only when all
URLs address the same Core instance or Enterprise cluster. The runner compares
available `/ping` version metadata but cannot prove cluster membership. Use at
least as many query workers as URLs to exercise every endpoint.

`create` aborts if the database exists, `reuse` leaves it intact, and `reset`
deletes and recreates it only after exact name confirmation. Never compare a
`--no-sync` or `--accept-partial` run with the durable default without clearly
labeling the difference.

Before binding a managed database workspace to a SQL database, the runner
verifies that its pinned executable starts for `--version` and reports the
expected edition and exact version. Repair incomplete installations with
`$setup-influxdb3`.

Each managed-server attempt has its own process log and lifecycle event with
start, readiness, shutdown, exit-code, and forced/unexpected-exit state. The
summary reports capped, email-redacted warning/error/fatal/panic samples.
Warnings and recoverable errors remain diagnostic; fatal/panic output, startup
failure, unexpected exit, or forced kill fail the run. Port probes retry briefly
with address reuse enabled while continuing to reject active listeners.
