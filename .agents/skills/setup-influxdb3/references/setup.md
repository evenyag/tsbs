# InfluxDB 3 managed setup reference

## Workspace

```text
.benchmarks/influxdb3/
├── installations/<edition>/<version>/<platform>/{manifest.json,influxdb3,python/,...}
└── databases/<database-id>/{manifest.json,data/,logs/}
```

Installations and database workspaces are reusable and checksum validated. Core and
Enterprise artifacts use the official archive pattern
`influxdb3-<edition>-<version>_<platform>.tar.gz` and its adjacent `.sha256`.
The complete vendor distribution is retained because the executable depends on
its adjacent bundled Python runtime. Reuse validates both the distribution
checksum and `influxdb3 --version`.

When `--version` is omitted, `install` and `prepare` parse the edition-specific
version variable from InfluxData's official quick-installer script without
executing it. Resolution failures do not fall back to a cached or guessed
version; pass an exact version for offline or reproducible operation.

Supported native platforms are Linux AMD64, Linux ARM64, and macOS ARM64.
Intel macOS and Windows are intentionally unsupported by the managed workflow.

## Database workspace defaults

- Bind HTTP to `127.0.0.1:8181` unless a different activation port is selected.
- Use `--object-store=file` and the database workspace's `data/` directory.
- Derive a stable node ID from the database ID.
- Add a distinct stable cluster ID for Enterprise.
- Use `--without-auth` for isolated managed benchmark databases.

S3 workspaces instead use `--object-store=s3`, a bucket, region, optional
compatible endpoint/HTTP opt-in, and a user-owned native AWS credentials JSON.
They do not pass `--data-dir`. Manifests pin only the credentials-file path and
non-secret storage settings; file contents may rotate in place and are never
copied, checksummed, printed, or placed in process environment variables.
Manifests without a storage field remain file-backed.

Enterprise requires an active license. Trial/home activation supplies the email
and license type only to the server process; neither value is written to the
database manifest. A license-file setup records only its absolute path and
never copies or reads the JWT contents. Use `--license-email-stdin` for a
one-line secret input; it overrides the compatible environment-variable path.
Activation logs redact both the supplied value and email-shaped text while
streaming, then receive a final scrub on cleanup.

Port probes enable `SO_REUSEADDR` and retry briefly so a recently stopped local
server in TCP `TIME_WAIT` does not cause a false conflict. An active listener is
still rejected.
